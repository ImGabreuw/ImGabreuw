## 🌌 About Me

Hi, I'm Gabriel Ken Kazama Geronazzo — a software engineer who believes that technology only makes sense when it connects people, solves real problems, and generates positive impact.

My journey has always been about turning challenges into opportunities to see and do things differently. I thrive on building bridges between people and ideas, and I see every project as a chance to innovate and grow. For me, sharing knowledge is multiplying opportunities: that's why I created my [digital garden](https://imgabreuw.github.io/notes/), a space where I compile everything I've learned programming, leading teams, and building businesses. Along this path, I've had the privilege of both mentoring and being mentored by incredible people — each exchange a genuine opportunity for growth.

## 🤝 Let's Connect!

If you value innovation, collaboration, and believe that technology can change lives, let's connect. I'm always open to new ideas, projects, and partnerships that challenge the ordinary and create real value.
